Udctl
=====

A bunch of script to automate housekeeping for user home data.


Update-home
-----------

Synchronize the home directory with the system base home in '/etc/skel'.
If a package update changes what should be the environment for new users, there
is a chance that existing users benefits from it.
The `udctl update-home` command propagates the changes from '/etc/skel' as long
as they do not conflict with changes made by the user.
